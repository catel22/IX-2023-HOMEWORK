Trees:
 - A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
 - Top Node is the root
 - A child is Node directly connected to another Node when moving away from the root
 - A parent is the converse notion of a child
 - Siblings are a group of Nodes with the same parent
 - A leaf is a Node with no children
 - The edge is the connection between one Node and another
 - Trees are non-linear
 - A Node can only point to a child, not a parent or sibling

Uses for Trees:
 - HTML DOM
 - Network Routing
 - Abstract syntax trees (Used to describe the syntax of a programming language)
 - Artificial Intelligence 
 - Folders in operating system
 - JSON

Binary Trees:
 - Each Node can have at most 2 children

Binary Search Trees:
 - Sorted in a particular way
 - Used to store data that is comparable
 - Less to the left, greater to the right on any parent Node
 - Search becomes very quick

Big-O of BST:
 - Insertion 0(log n) 
 - Searching 0(log n)
