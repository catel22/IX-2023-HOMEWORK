Hash Tables (Hash Map):
 - JS has Objects & Maps
 - Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs
 - They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered
 - Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations:
  - Finding values
  - Adding new values
  - Removing values

Th HASH part
 - To implement using an array
 - In order to look up values by key, we need a way to convert keys into valid array indices
 - A function that performs this task is called a hash function

Intro to Hash Functions:
- Takes an input of any size and outputs a value of constant size

What makes a good hash function?
 - Fast (ie: constant time)
 - Doesn't cluster outputs at specific indecies, but distributes uniformly
 - Deterministic (same input yields same output)

Dealing with collisions:
 - Separate Chaining (array of values at an index)
 - Linear Probing (checking if index contains a value, move value to next index (if no value there))

Big-O of Hash Tables:
 - Insertion 0(1) 
 - Removal 0(1) 
 - Access 0(1)
